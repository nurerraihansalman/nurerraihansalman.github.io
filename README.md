Hi there! I’m Nurer Raihan Salman, a passionate Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) student with a keen interest in Data Sciecnce and Machine Learning. I’m currently studying at United International University, where I’m honing my skills in programming languages, or projects.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring new technologies or playing football. I’m always eager to learn and take on new challenges, so feel free to connect with me if you share similar interests or if you have any exciting projects or opportunities!
