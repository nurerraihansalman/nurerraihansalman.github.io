            <ul>
                <p>I am currently working on a beginner-level AI project where I’m exploring the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence. The project involves building a simple chatbot that can understand and respond to basic questions. This is a great way for me to dive into Natural Language Processing (NLP) and learn how machine learning models can be trained to handle text data.</p>
                <p>While working on this project, I’m gaining hands-on experience with Python and libraries like NLTK and Scikit-learn. It’s a fun and challenging project, and I'm looking forward to expanding my skills as I continue to develop it.</p>
